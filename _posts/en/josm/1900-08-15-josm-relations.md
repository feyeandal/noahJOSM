Relations
==========

In the [Beginnerâ€™s Guide](/en/beginner) we explained that there are three
types of objects that can be drawn in OpenStreetMap - points (nodes), lines (ways), and
polygons (closed ways). Lines contain numerous points, and the line itself carries
the attributes that define what it represents.  Polygons are the same as
lines, except that the the line must finish where it begins in order to
form a shape.

But there is one other type of object in OpenStreetMap, it is
called relations.  In the same way that a line consists of other
points, a relation contains a group of other objects, it can be points,
lines, or polygons. It is important to understand and know how to properly
edit relations in order to advance one's editing skills.

For example, you want to map a building that has courtyards
in the center.  You would need to draw a polygon around the outside of
the building, and you would want other polygons around the courtyards
to indicate that they are not part of the building.  This is an example
of a relation.  The relation would contain several polygons - and the
attributes of the building would be attached to the relation, not the
polygons.

![An example of a multipolygon][]

Relations are used to represent anything that requires a collection of
objects to define.  Other examples are bus routes (a collections of
lines), long and complex objects (rivers or roads), or multiple polygons
that are all part of one location (like buildings in a university).

There are mainly four types of relations you will encounter in OSM:
Multipolygons, Routes, Boundaries, and Restrictions (such as, no left
turns).  In this section we will cover Multipolygons and Routes.

Creating Multipolygon Relations
-------------------------------

Let's see how to create a multipolygon relation like the one shown above.

-   First, draw your shapes. In this case, we will draw three polygons, an
    outer rectangle, and two smaller rectangles.

![Multipolygon ways][]

-   Select all of the polygons. Remember you can select multiple objects
    by holding SHIFT and clicking on each.
-   Go to *Presets->Man Made->Man Made->Building*.

![Building preset][]

-   Click on "New Relation."

![New relation][]

-   You should now see the relations window. This is a bit complex
    because now you are adding tags to a collection of ways.

![Building relation][]

-   Observe that at the top of the panel are the tags for the relation. These tags
    work the same way as tags always work.
-   At the bottom is a list of the members of the relation. This relation has
    three members - that is, the three ways that are part of our relation.
-   We need to do a couple things to finish defining our multipolygon. First,
    notice that because we used the building preset we already have one tag
    defined for us, *building=yes*. We need to add one more tag that defines
    the **type** of the relation. We must add a tag that says *type=multipolygon*.
-   Click in the tag box and add this tag.

![Type multipolygon][]

-   Next we need to define what are called **roles**. Each member of a relation
    has a role, which indicates what that member's purpose is. In this case, the
    role of the outside polygon must be defined as **outer** and the role of the
    two inner polygons must be defined as **inner**. These are the roles that are
    available for members of a multipolygon.
-   In the lower left panel select each member in the list. You can see the member
    that is selected will be highlighted in the map window. Enter **outer** and
    **inner** for the correct polygons.

![Outer or inner role][]

-   Click OK and your multipolygon relation is complete!

![New multipolygon][]

When you create a multipolygon like this it will be rendered on the map like so:

Multipolygons can be used for any complex object that requires inner and outer polygons, like
a building or a river with patches of land inside it. Detailed multipolygon information can be
found on the [OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:multipolygon).

Summary
-------

Relations can be difficult to understand and do not need to be used often,
but they are necessary to know about. Every so often you may realize that you
need a relation to map something correctly. Find more information about relations on the OSM Wiki.
