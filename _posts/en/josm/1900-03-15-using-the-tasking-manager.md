#Using the Tasking Manager
OSM Tasking Manager is a mapping tool designed and built for the Humanitarian OSM Team collaborative mapping. The purpose of the tool is to divide up a mapping job into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping validated.

This approach facilitates the distribution of tasks to the various mappers in a context of emergency. It also permits to control the progress and the homogeneity of the work done.

Project NOAH-ISAIAH used the Tasking Manager to be able to complete the mapping tasks in each of the 16 provinces rapidly and systematically. The objective of the project is to finish mapping all the structures in the selected provinces.
